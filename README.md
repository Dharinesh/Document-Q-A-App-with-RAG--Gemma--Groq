# Document Question Answering with RAGs, Gemma, and GroqAPI

This project is a Streamlit application that implements a document question-answering system using the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach. 
It combines vector similarity search for retrieving relevant document chunks with a language model for generating answers based on the retrieved context.
